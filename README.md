# get_next_line #3

My third project of the 42 school Codam. The main goal is to learn how to read from a file or the standard input.

Compile with ```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=32 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c``` or ```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=32 get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c``` to include the bonus. If you exclude the -D flag, there is a default buffer size of 32. Buffer size can be changed by the user.
